## Government Agencies Responsible for Accessibility
[General Services Administration (GSA)](https://www.gsa.gov/), The [U.S. Access Board](https://www.access-board.gov/) and [U.S. Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/) are examples of agencies who play a role oversight and around Section 508. These agencies also have other roles as well. 

## Chief Accessibility Officers (CAO) / Chief Diversity Officer (CDO)
CAO's & CDOs often play a key role in ensuring that staff are able to get the support that they need to do their jobs. Understanding the key barriers in a organization's digital infrastructure is a key part of that. 

## Chief Information Officers (CIO) / Chief Technical Officers (CTO)
Often the responsibility evaluate enterprise-wide accessibility falls on the CIO or CTO. Often the role of assessing if an organizations technical infrastructure is able to to effectively support users with permanent, temporary and situational disabilities falls as a responsibility of the CIO or CTO. 

## People with Disabilities (and Allies)
Many people who have disabilities and advocates may review an ACR to help understand how well their needs will be supported. It is important to note that accessibility is a journey, the expectation is that technology evolves with the needs of the users and the ecosystem in which it works.

# Affinity Groups 
Many organizations have affinity groups for people with disabilities to support each other in getting the support they need. They may not be able to understand the technical elements of an ACR, but should be able to understand the barriers that people with different disabilities will face. 

# Accessibility Organizations
There are a range of accessibility organizations who are looking to support people with disabilities. They may have examples of good/bad practices which affect people with specific disabilities.
